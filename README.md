# swift-unity-integration

Integration of Unity build into an iOS(Swift) project.

Two-way messaging example between Unity and iOS.

Using [jiulongw's instructions](https://github.com/jiulongw/swift-unity/tree/master/demo/unity)


### Demo Instructions

  1. Open the Unity project and build the iOS platform.

      We won't be using the generated project directly so you can save the iOS build into a temporary folder.
    
    
 
  2. Open the SwiftUnityLoader xcodeproj.

      Unity post build script already linked the Classes and Libraries folders.
    


  3. Run the demo in a real device.
